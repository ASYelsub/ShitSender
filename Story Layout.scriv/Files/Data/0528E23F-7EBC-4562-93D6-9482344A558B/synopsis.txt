In Mitsuru’s big car, the two drive back together. They play their favorite music and then stop at a naturey alcove to get out and stretch their legs. They end up sitting in the open trunk of Mitsuru’s car and watching the cars pass. From here, they make out. They stop, though, because Mitsuru gets flustered and stressed, remembering how Yukari took advantage of her when they were younger, she also panics because of all the people passing them and fear of her being seen by someone important.
